                <h1>Food for a family</h1>
                <p>When a family sits down together, it helps them handle the stresses of daily life and the hassles of
                    day-to-day existence. Eating together tends to promote more sensible eating habits, which in turn
                    helps family members manage their weight more easily.</p>

                <h1>Shelter for a family</h1>
                <p>For families who live in women's shelters, provision of salubrious activities supports their recovery
                    and resilience. In many fields, natural environments are known to provide such benefits. Using an
                    action research design, this study explored professionals' perspective on the benefits of nature for
                    family life in women's shelters.</p>

                <h1>Education for a child</h1>
                <p>Education builds the spirit of teamwork and creates a sense of discipline in children, which helps in
                    their growth as well as the growth and development of the nation in their future. Education acquired
                    during childhood teaches and moulds a child in their communication and helps them to work as a team.
